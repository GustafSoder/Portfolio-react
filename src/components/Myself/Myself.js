          I'm 28 years old and I've recently graduated from Ume√• University with
          a M.Sc degree in Computer Science. I'm currently looking for a job as
          a software developer. I have a passion for programming and I'm always
          eager to learn new things. I'm a team player and I enjoy working in a
          team. I'm also a quick learner and I'm not afraid to take on new
          challenges.
        </p>
